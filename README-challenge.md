## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first project using my brand new html and css skills. 

I learned a lot about my workflow. Next time, I would use a mobile first approach. 

I also got stuck on laying out the different sections using flexbox. My 'change'-link wouldn't move to the left. I'm looking for feedback on how to fix this issue.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

Like I mentioned above, for my next project I will use a mobile first approach.

I'm planning on using Bootstrap for my next project, so I get to practice the use of these short cuts as well.

If my next project goes well, I will start learning JavaScript.
